# Tony's gargage


### In Tony's garage, there are many beautiful cars. They followed their owner who drove to work and back home every day. 


### A sports car followed the owner home and was parked in the garage. It stretched and looked around at its new home, hey! What's that new thing next to me?


### "Hello! Who are you?" asked the sports car.


### "Hello! I'm an electric car, you are welcome!"


### "electric car,? What is that? You look so ugly, look how beautiful my clothes are!" said the sports car arrogantly.


### "Although I'm not as pretty as you are, the owner likes me! drive me to the work, supermarket, I help them pick up their children every day..." The electric car whispered.


### "You go to those dirty places every day, no wonder you have a strange smell on your body!" The sports car said while twisting, making a harsh sound.


### The electric car responded calmly, "You are fast and fancy but I would not create any carbon dioxide. I am better to the environment and that is why I could accompany the owner every day."


### "Bah! Impossible, you big liar, anyway, I'm fancier than you, better looking than you, and I have a powerful gas engine! Our owner must like me more!" the sports car shouted.


### The electric car stopped bothering with sports cars anymore.


### When dinner time came, the owner came home from work and opened up the garage door. He looked outside and it is a beautiful day! He looked at the sports car. The sports car shouted in his mind, "please pick me! take me out today!" However, thier owner looked at the green grass and the blue sky and walked directly at the electric car. 


### The electric car heard it and said: "Now you know, although you are fast and beautiful, you will pollute the environment, so it will be the best for you to stay in the garage. In the future, your family will only become fewer and fewer, and my family members will become more and more." 


### In the end, the sports car was locked in the garage for a long time and was finally sold at a recycle place. on the other hand, the electric car still followed its owner to work, supermarkets, and pick up their children every day...
